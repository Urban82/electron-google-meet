# electron-google-meet
Google Meet Desktop application with Electron

## Usage
This application put the icon in the tray bar: if the icon is not working for you, use the option
`--disable-tray` on the command line to avoid that minimizing the main window, there is no way to
bring it back.

Use the command line switch --room-id=<id> to connect directly to the meeting with the specified
room ID.
